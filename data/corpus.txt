# Python Basics
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
Python supports object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming.
Python has built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
Python's standard libraries include math, random, datetime, and os.
Python supports exception handling using try, except, finally blocks.
Python functions can have default arguments, *args, and **kwargs.
Python supports file I/O operations like open(), read(), write(), and close().

# Python Advanced
Python supports list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.
Python supports decorators to modify the behavior of functions or classes.
Python has modules and packages to organize code.
Python supports generators using the yield keyword.
Python supports context managers using the with statement.
Python supports multithreading and multiprocessing for concurrency.

# AI Basics
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data.
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers.
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models.
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.
Reinforcement learning trains agents using rewards and penalties.
Common AI algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and k-means clustering.

# Python for AI
Python libraries for AI include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Python libraries for ML include scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
Python can be used to preprocess data, build models, and visualize results.
Python supports neural network implementation using frameworks like Keras.
Python allows model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Python supports saving and loading models using joblib, pickle, or framework-specific functions.

# Python AI Tips
Vectorized operations in NumPy are faster than loops.
Use train-test split to evaluate machine learning models.
Normalize or standardize data for better model performance.
Use GPU acceleration for training deep learning models.
Document your AI code clearly for reproducibility.
